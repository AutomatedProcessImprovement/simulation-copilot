# Simulation Copilot

A prototype to explore a possibility to handle simulation scenario generation using the conversational UI.

## Milestones

- [x] Generate a single component of the scenario with Python code (calendars)
- [x] Generate a single component of the scenario with LLM (calendars)
- [ ] Generate the resource model with Python code (calendars)
- [ ] Generate the resource model with LLM (calendars)
- [ ] Generate a simple scenario with Python code
- [ ] Generate a simple scenario with LLM using the Python code as a "tool"
- [ ] Provide a simple scenario and ask LLM to apply some changes
- [ ] Increase complexity: add more components of the simulation scenario or more adjustments
